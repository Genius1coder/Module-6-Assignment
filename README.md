QUESTION 1

Monolithic architecture is an architectural pattern, where the entire application is developed as a single,

self-contained unit. This means that all the functionality of the application is bundled into a single

codebase, and all the components of the application share the same memory space and resources. In a monolithic

 architecture, the application is typically composed of multiple layers such as presentation layer, business 

 logic layer, and data access layer. These layers are tightly coupled, and any change in one layer can affect 

 the other layers.

QUESTION 2

Microservices is an architectural pattern where an application is composed of small, independent, and 

self-contained services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice typically performs a 

specific business capability or function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of the other 

services.

QUESTION 3

The backend architecture, which appeal to me most is the Microservices architecture. This is because it is 

flexible, scalable and maintainable. In addition, it is ideal for complex applications that require high 

degree of scalability and it is fault tolerance. Its construction allows for better utilization of resources 

that can improve overall application performance.

QUESTION 4

Node.js itself is not a multithreaded language, but it does provide support for asynchronous programming,

 which can be used to write concurrent and parallel code. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O

  model, which allows it to handle multiple requests or events simultaneously. When Node.js receives a 

  request, it delegates the work to a single thread, which handles the I/O operation asynchronously. This 

  means that the thread can continue to handle other requests while the I/O operation is in progress, without 

  blocking or waiting for it to complete.

QUESTION 5

REPL stands for "Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop". It is a simple interactive programming environment that allows one 

to type in commands, have them executed, and see the results immediately. In a REPL environment, the "Read" 

step involves reading a command or expression typed in by the user. The "Evaluation" step involves evaluating 

the command or expression to produce a result. The "Print" step involves displaying the result to the user. 

The "Loop" step involves repeating this process, allowing the user to enter new commands or expressions.
